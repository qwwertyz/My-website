                <p>My name is hoyoki and hello :D</p>

                <h3>about me</h3>
                <p>855 Life:

                    ​

                    ​8 years in Shanghai, China.

                    ​5 years in Michigan, USA.

                    ​5 years in Utrecht, the Netherlands.​​

                    2008: I was born in Shanghai, China.



                    2016: I moved to Michigan, USA, when my mom started her PhD studies. In Michigan, I started my new
                    life: learning English, making friends, and doing winter sports. I loved skating and snowboarding,
                    observed the chipmunk, and looked for the skunks.

                    ​

                    In 2021, I moved to Utrecht, the Netherlands, with my family and began learning Dutch at the Ithaka
                    Language School. However, a few months later, the Russia–Ukraine war broke out, and the school
                    needed to provide more space for incoming Ukrainian children. As a result, I was transferred to the
                    regular Dutch middle school, Leidsche Rijn College.</p>
