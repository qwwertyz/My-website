Hello! This is a personal website I made with tribute! I wanted to make this mainly so I would have a place to share my thoughts and art. 
I do have socials but I have the feeling that there's always a certain pressure to keep posting which I don't like. This'll probably become a place I check-in everyday and post something.

I started making this by following the tutorial on https://tribute.athena.hackclub.com/, then I shifted to grinding on codeacadmy and w3schools to learn to code, but also chatgpt for debugging.
The hardest part of all this is definitely making the flexbox work. I followed different tutorials for different parts of the project I wanted to make, but I just ended up with
10 different classes nested in each other and a mess of a css doc. Then when I finally wanted to get started on fixing the layout flexbox keeps giving up on me
and everytime I fix something another would break, and I have to go searching through all the classes to figure out what the bug is caused by. My blood and tears...

What I learned for next time: START WITH THE LAYOUT!! If you start by trying to make everything asthetically perfect it's not going to work. Make the boxes and add contents later. Also
know what your classes are and which children they have. Saves a lot of work.
