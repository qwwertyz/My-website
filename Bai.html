    <p>Shes's night demon who kills human adventurers. Quite cold and pan-faced.</p>
    <h3>lore:</h3>
    <p>Legends say that Adam's first wife is Lilith.

        Their offspring blended in with humans, hidden from view. The night demons are active during the night,
        searching and hunting for flesh and blood. Of the night demons, rarely are male. The horned creatures have wings
        and tails that can be hidden and revealed as wished, and possibly razor-sharp teeth.

        But in the lavender fields, one family line of night demons still exist, waiting to return.</p>
