            <p>My name is Zoe and welcome :D</p>
            <p>First of all, I like drawing and gaming and making games
                and playing the piano and violin and reading. A lot, huh?
                Drawing used to be a big part of my life, but ever since
                I got exposed to the wonders of surfing online and all the
                distractions on it I've been getting misleaded... It's ok
                though. I'm older now and I'm more focused on creating other
                stuff... Games for instance. Hackclub is really nice.
                Also I'm trying to compete for Shiba but I don't think
                I have enough time for it.</p>
            <p>I keep thinking why I haven't came with the idea
                to make my website earlier...</p>
            <p>Apart from all the serious stuff
                I also like to draw and create my own little projects and
                games in the meantime(check them out!!->)</p>
