            <h3>Fatty Frog(2025)</h3>
            <p>Fatty Frog is my first game and was originally made for Shiba
                Arcade.
                It's a 2D puzzle platformer game where you jump left and right instead of having 3 buttons (up, left,
                right)
                compared to many other platformers. I wanted to experiment with two-key movement and, while making it
                more
                puzzel-like than the usual platformers, such as Knight Errant. </p>

            <p>Lore:

                You are Fatty Frog, the leader of the army (group of frogs), admired for your large size. However, after
                a
                lengthy winter slumber, you awoke to find that you are no longer overweight. Soooo venture out and
                consume
                enough Fatty Flies to regain your esteemed status!</p>
