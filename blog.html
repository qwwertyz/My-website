        <h1>Stuff</h1>
        <p>I like cats! Although I personally don't have any cats, my neighbor does and I consider the cats
            (half)mine. Also, I take care of them reguarly because my neighbors travel a lot betweeen Italy and their
            place of residence here.</p>

        <p>Yasmeen(left) is the sister. She's a really sweet and sticky kitty. V is the chonki boy. He's called v
            because there's a white V shaped patch of fur on the back of his
            neck, but now that he's fat it's more of a half O(maybe we should start calling him U instead)</p>
        <p>honorable mention:</p>
        <p>Moby, my friend's orange kitty. He's a silly cat and is kind of chubby. Named after the infamous Moby
            D***, he reigns the open seas with his unsinkable body of a boat.</p>
