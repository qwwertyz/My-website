        <h3>Fatty Frog(2025)</h3>
        <p>Fatty Frog is my first game and was originally made for the HackClub You Ship We Ship program, Shiba Arcade.
            It's a 2D puzzle platformer game where you jump left and right instead of having 3 buttons (up, left, right)
            compared to many other platformers. I wanted to experiment with two-key movement and, while making it more
            puzzel-like than the usual platformers, such as Knight Errant. </p>

        <p>Lore:

            You are Fatty Frog, the leader of the army (group of frogs), admired for your large size. However, after a
            lengthy winter slumber, you awoke to find that you are no longer overweight. Soooo venture out and consume
            enough Fatty Flies to regain your esteemed status!</p>

        <h3>Automated python code for game(2024)</h3>
        <p>I was playing a minion tower minigame in a game I was kind of obsessed with a year ago
            when I realized that it's really repetitve and time consuming. So I made a python code to automate it.
