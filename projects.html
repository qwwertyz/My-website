        <h3><a href='https://zoeyao.itch.io/fatty-frog'>Fatty frog (2025)</a></h3>

        <p>Fatty Frog is my first game and was originally made for Shiba
            Arcade.
            It's a 2D puzzle platformer game where you jump left and right instead of having 3 buttons (up, left,
            right)
            compared to many other platformers. I wanted to experiment with two-key movement and, while making it
            more
            puzzel-like than the usual platformers, such as Knight Errant. </p>

        <p>Lore:

            You are Fatty Frog, the leader of the army (group of frogs), admired for your large size. However, after
            a
            lengthy winter slumber, you awoke to find that you are no longer overweight. Soooo venture out and
            consume
            enough Fatty Flies to regain your esteemed status!</p>

        <h3>Automated python code for game(2024)</h3>
        <p>I was playing a minion tower minigame in a game I was kind of obsessed with a year ago
            when I realized that it's really repetitve and time consuming. So I made a python code to automate it.
