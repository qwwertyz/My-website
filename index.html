    <h1 style="background-color: #FED9B7;">Welcome to my website!</h1>

    <p style="color: cadetblue;">My name is Zoe and welcome :D</p>
    <p>First of all, I like drawing anime and gaming and making games
        and playing the piano and violin and reading. A lot, huh? 
        Drawing used to be a big part of my life, but ever since
        I got exposed to the wonders of surfing online and all the
        distractions on it I've been getting misleaded... It's ok
        though. I'm older now and I'm more focused on creating other 
        stuff... Games for instance. Hackclub is really nice.
         Also I'm trying to compete for Shiba but I don't think 
        I have enough time for it.
        
        
    </p>
    <p>Some serious stuff(for college ugh):
        I'm working on college applications and trying
        to get myself admitted... In the meantime I'm participating in
        the Informatica Olympiad and also the EGOI. I'm also busying 
        making games and participating in hackclub events(they're awesome,
        check them out!). I keep thinking why I haven't came with the idea
        to make my website earlier...</p>
    <p>Apart from all the serious stuff 
        I also like to draw and create my own little projects and
        games in the meantime(check them out!!->)</p>
